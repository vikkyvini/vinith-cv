            <p>Experienced IT professional with over 11 years of expertise in designing, implementing, and managing secure IT infrastructures, with a focus on cloud security and compliance. For the past five years, I have specialized in cybersecurity engineering, leveraging deep technical knowledge to protect organizations against evolving cyber threats.

                I have extensive experience working with Azure and AWS platforms, where Iâ€™ve successfully implemented cloud security frameworks, integrated advanced security tools, and optimized multi-cloud environments for performance and security. My skills include endpoint detection and response (EDR), data loss prevention (DLP), and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. These capabilities have been honed while working across diverse industries such as government, insurance, and taxation, enabling me to address unique security challenges effectively.
                
                As a Senior Systems Engineer at H&R Block, I have led key initiatives in securing cloud environments, integrating advanced threat detection tools, and developing policies for data protection and access control. I have collaborated with cross-functional teams to implement EDR solutions, enhance DLP strategies, and ensure adherence to compliance standards, such as PCI and other regulatory requirements. My work has resulted in improved system resilience, reduced risk exposure, and seamless security integrations.
                
                Driven by a passion for innovation, I excel at bridging the gap between technical solutions and business needs. With a strong focus on aligning security strategies with organizational goals, I am committed to delivering scalable, efficient, and secure IT solutions that empower businesses to thrive in a rapidly evolving digital landscape..</p>
